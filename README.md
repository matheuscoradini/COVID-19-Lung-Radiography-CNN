# COVID-19-Lung-Radiography-CNN-Kaggle

"A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors have created a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images. In our current release, there are 219 COVID-19 positive images, 1341 normal images and 1345 viral pneumonia images." from https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

This repo includes a Convolutional Neural Network that results a 0.96 precision on COVID-19 class.

This notebook was written on Google Colab, using GPU. The data is downloaded directly from Kaggle, using Kaggle API.
